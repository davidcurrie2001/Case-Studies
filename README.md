# Case Studies

The [RDA Sample Type Classification WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/sample-type-classification-wg/activity/)
will develop a recommendation for one or more vocabularies for global,
cross-domain classification of material sample types.  The
vocabularies are intended to cover all types of samples being
investigated in the sciences.  But the scope will be limited to the
top-level classification, the detailed description of the samples will
be left to existing domain-specific vocabularies.

This repository shall be used to gather input from various scientific
communities.  We'd like to learn about the samples being dealt with in
your work.  Therefore we invite you to submit a case study.
