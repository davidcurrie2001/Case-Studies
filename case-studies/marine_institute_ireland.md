# Samples in the xyz community

## About the xyz community

*Please provide a short description of the community or scientific
domain you are representing.*

We are the state agency responsible for marine research, technology development and innovation in Ireland.  We carry out environmental, fisheries, and aquaculture surveys and monitoring programmes to meet Ireland’s national and international legal requirements. We provide scientific and technical advice to Government to help inform policy and to support the sustainable development of Ireland’s marine resource.  We aim to safeguard Ireland’s unique marine heritage through research and environmental monitoring.  Our research, strategic funding programmes, and national marine research platforms support the development of Ireland’s maritime economy.  More details are available at https://www.marine.ie/

Methodology documents for Ireland's fishery data collection programme can be found at https://www.dcmap-ireland.ie/methodologies

## Samples in the xyz community

*Describe the samples that you are dealing with in your community.
Give an overview of the variety of different samples.*

Biological samples include whole organisms (e.g. individual fish) as well as parts of biological organisms (e.g. scales, fin clips, otoliths).

Non-biological samples include samples of water and sediment.

## Characterising properties

*What are the properties that can be used to distinguish different
types of samples being used in your domain?  What properties
distinguish them from samples in other domains?*

Typically all samples will have certain information recorded: where, when, who, and how.  We record date/time of collection, location of collection, and sampling personnel.  The resolution of these values can depend on how the sample was collected - for example, sometimes only a broad collection area is known rather than a specific latitude/longitude.

Most samples will be collected in the sea, but some will be collected in rivers/freshwater environments.

For biological samples we record the species (or possibly a higher taxonomic group if species can't be identified).  Depending on the sampling programme other details such as the length, weight, sex, maturity, and age of the individual will also be recorded.

Details about how the sample was obtained will also be recorded but these will depend on the sampling programme.  For example, when sampling commercial fishing vessels we would record details about the fishing vessel and its fishing activity.  When collecting samples on our research vessels we would record haul numbers and size category.


## Vocabularies and metadata standards

*Are there any vocabularies or metadata standards being used in your
community to describe your samples?*

There are lots of controlled vocabularies that are used.  For example, those published by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) https://vocab.ices.dk/, and NERC https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/

For species the World Register of Marine Species is often used (https://www.marinespecies.org/), along with the FAO's List of Species for Fishery Statistics Purposes https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/collection/asfis

ICES have published a list of biological sample types: https://vocab.ices.dk/?codetypeguid=8febdbd6-43ef-44e3-aed0-d151f6a2c9e6

Our Data Catalogue (http://data.marine.ie/) publishes metadata for datasets and services in ISO 19115/19139 based XML format (in compliance with the INSPIRE directive) and provides comprehensive metadata for each dataset.

## Sample PIDs being used

*If you are using any PIDs to identify your samples, such as IGSN,
please provide some information about this.*

No, we currently do not use PIDS for sample identifiers.  Typically different sections or teams use their own sample numbering systems which are not coordinated centrally.

## Authors

*Please add your name and the names of colleagues (and optionally
further information, such as ORCID iD, affiliations or email
addresses) that have contributed to this case study.*
